# RSS Feed

The plugin auto generates a RSS feed of your images to be subscribed to by other people. 

The feed will be available under your defined `storeid`, by default that's `moments`. If you have defined a custom `pageid`, the feed will be available under that slug.

You can access the feed in a browser like this: \
`https://your-website.test/moments/feed.xml`
